<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<h1>Lexoris — Terms of Use</h1>
<p>Effective Date: 1 November 2025
Entity: Lexoris (ABN 914 488 505 45), a sole trader based in Sydney NSW Australia
Contact: admin@lexoris.com.au<p>

<p>1. Acceptance
By creating an account or using Lexoris you agree to these Terms. If you do not accept them, please do not use the service.<p>

<p>2. Our Service
Lexoris provides a web-based transcription platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to convert spoken audio into text for legal professionals. All processing and storage occur on Australian servers. Transcripts are automatically deleted once downloaded by the user.<p>

<p>3. Accuracy and Responsibility
AI transcription may contain errors or omissions. Lexoris does not guarantee absolute accuracy. You are responsible for reviewing, editing, and verifying all content before relying on it in any professional or legal context.<p>

<p>4. User Conduct
You agree not to upload unlawful, defamatory, or confidential recordings without consent; attempt to reverse-engineer, copy, or resell the platform; or interfere with the platform’s security or functionality. Lexoris may suspend or terminate access if these rules are breached.<p>

<p>5. Accounts
Users must provide accurate information when registering (first name, last name, email, and place of work). You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials.<p>

<p>6. Payment and Billing
Paid plans are billed through Stripe on a recurring monthly basis. By subscribing, you authorise recurring charges until you cancel. Prices are in AUD and include GST unless otherwise stated. No refunds are provided for partial billing periods, except as required by the Australian Consumer Law.<p>

<p>7. Data and Storage
Audio and transcript data are processed securely on Australian servers and automatically deleted once you download them. User account data (name, email, workplace) are retained only as needed for service delivery and billing.<p>

<p>8. Intellectual Property
Lexoris retains ownership of the website, code, and branding. You retain ownership of your own audio and transcript content.<p>

<p>9. Limitation of Liability
To the extent permitted by law, Lexoris is not liable for any loss or damage (including indirect or consequential loss) arising from use of the service, reliance on AI-generated output, or interruptions to access. Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under the Australian Consumer Law.<p>

<p>10. Termination
You may cancel your account at any time. Lexoris may terminate or suspend access for misuse or legal compliance reasons. Upon termination, remaining account data will be securely deleted in line with our Privacy Policy.<p>

<p>11. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of New South Wales, Australia, and any disputes will be heard in the courts of that jurisdiction.</p>
